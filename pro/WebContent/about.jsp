So who are we? Well that's a philosophical question to answer, but in short, we are a just a bunch of crazy folks who believe they have been bestowed with the great power and responsibility to change the way people commute. Our mission is to make taxi rides hassle free, convenient, and reliable, and most importantly punctual! And mind you, we take this responsibility, very, very seriously.
It all began on a sunny morning in June 2011 as our founders began operations in a small roof top bungalow where their idea would become a reality. Since then, our operations have taken over Agra, Ahmedabad, Ajmer, Allahabad, Ambala, Amritsar, Aurangabad, Bangalore, Baroda, Bhavnagar, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Gwalior, Hubli-Dharwad, Hyderabad, Indore, Jabalpur, Jaipur, Jalandhar, Jamnagar, Jodhpur, Kanpur, Kota, Lucknow, Ludhiana, Madurai, Mangalore, Mathura, Mumbai, Mysore, Nagpur, Nashik, Pune, Rajkot, Shimla, Surat, Udaipur, Ujjain, Varanasi, Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam with over four lakhs happy customers. Going forward, we plan on infiltrating all major cities in India and ultimately pursuing operations in countries abroad.
So what is this astonishing power that enables our customers to 'for sure' receive a safe, reliable, and clean taxi? Well, we have enabled all our drivers with devices which have our top-secret technology installed that can accurately relay critical data back to our headquarters, which is then used to match, you the customer, with the most convenient taxi possible.
Whether you're heading to a special event, coming home from a late night party, or just want to get away for a weekend, we will happily serve you! We offer Point-to-Point hires, Local Packages, Outstation services, and Airport Transfers. And since convenience is the name of the game, we allow all of our customers to book a cab by using our smart phone application, our website, or calling our infamous telephone number, 60601010.
